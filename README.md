# Chess-Engine
 A basic chess engine made to be really fast
 
 > [!Note]
> The code was written with the intention of being as fast as possible and as such, it is often not that readable.
 Keep in mind that this project has been made 2 years ago, some design choices are really poor and most optimizations are useless regarding compiler optimizations.

 
## Installation
 Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/Milan-Torres/Chess-Engine/releases) section and download the latest binary. Afterwards, open a terminal and run the program

 > [!WARNING]
