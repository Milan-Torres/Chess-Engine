# Chess-Engine
 A basic chess engine made to be really fast.
 This is an engine, not a game, it is the ability to check for mates and can prevent you from doing illegal moves but will not do so by default. If you run the binary you'll get a demonstration of its capabilities by selecting any piece to view all the legal moves.  
 This engine was originally planned as an API for a lot of different things, unfortunately my hard drive has been wiped out and I lost most of the implementations.   
 
 > [!Note]
> The code was written with the intention of being as fast as possible and as such, it is often not that readable.
 Keep in mind that this project has been made 2 years ago, some design choices are really poor and most optimizations are useless regarding compiler optimizations.

 
## Installation
 Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/Milan-Torres/Chess-Engine/releases) section and download the latest binary. Afterwards, open a terminal and run the program

 > [!WARNING]  
> Don't forget to make the binary executable on your machine !
> You can do so by running `chmod +x chess-engine`
